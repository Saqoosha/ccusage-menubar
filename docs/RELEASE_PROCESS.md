## Troubleshooting

rm -rf .build build
./scripts/build.sh
```

### GitHub CLI Not Installed

gh auth login
```

### Wrong Version in Release
Make sure VERSION file is updated before running release script.

### Can't Push Tags
Ensure you have push access to the repository and are on the main branch.

## GitHub Release Notes

The release script automatically generates release notes from git commits. To ensure good release notes:

1. Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `chore:` for maintenance

2. Keep commit messages clear and concise

3. The script excludes version bump commits automatically

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Automated testing before release
- [ ] Notarization support (when needed)
- [ ] Homebrew formula updates
- [ ] Auto-update functionality
